Solutions to the exercises of [erlang.org's course](https://www.erlang.org/course).

If you're learning Erlang, you probably should NOT read these solutions. It's better for you if you try to solve the exercises on your own.

**Development setup**: [Getting started with Erlang & Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-erlang.html).  
Currently not using `rebar(3)`. Tried it and doesn't seem as easy to start with as something like `npm`, and the exercises don't seem to need it.  
Also, this is not a repo to take good practices from :P. For example, one should never put test code in production code.
